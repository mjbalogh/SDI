<p>This project is a departure from my standard zombie fare. Instead, My story is about tracking job-hunting progress. I have actually put together an internal site to track my progress while in search of a new job. Albeit, I did not use just HTML and JavaScript, but built out a full blown Ruby on Rails application. I have other tools to track my progress, but I wanted to keep my web design skills fresh. The data provided in this example is representative of the actual data, but identifyable information has been changed. It is also not the code that I used for the practice site.</p>
